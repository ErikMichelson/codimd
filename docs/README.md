## About CodiMD
CodiMD lets you create real-time collaborative markdown notes.  
It is a node-js based web application. 
You can test-drive it by visiting our [CodiMD demo server](https://demo.codimd.org).
It is inspired by Hackpad, Etherpad and similar collaborative editors.  
This project originated with the team at [HackMD](https://hackmd.io) and now forked into its own organisation. A longer writeup can be read in the [history doc](history.md).

similar project.
